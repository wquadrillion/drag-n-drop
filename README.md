**Goal**: Create drag & drop functionality to move Div elements from one cell to another in a table

**Technology**: HTML, JavaScript, CSS

**Steps**:

1\. Create a HTML5 web page with a Table with 3 rows and 3 columns.

a. Each cell of the table will have one rectangle box. This box will be a ‘DIV’ html element.

b. Each box should be uniquely numbered like 100, 200, 300, 400…900

c. The color of each box should be different.

2\. User should be able to drag a rectangle box from one cell to another.

3\. When a box is dragged from a cell (source) and dropped on another cell (destination), the box in

the destination cell should be moved to the source cell.

a. For e.g. if a box from R1C2 is dragged and dropped to R3C3 then the dropped box should

stay in the R3C3 and the box that was already in the R3C3 should be moved to R1C2.

1\. While dragging the box, its color should fade.

2\. The box should move with the cursor.

3\. The box from destination cell to original cell should be moved with a slow animation so that user

can see the box moving.

multiple times

4\. Add an undo button somewhere on the screen which will undo the last user action

5\. Add another button "Add row", which will add another row with 3 cells (e.g. 1000, 1100, 1200...) everytime it is pressed. 

The drag, drop and undo functionality should work for cells in the new rows also.
